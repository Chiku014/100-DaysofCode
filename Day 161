Day 161/200: Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid

Problem Statement #2257

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given the dimensions of a grid, m and n, along with two 2D arrays: guards and walls. 
Each array contains the [row, col] coordinates for the guards and walls.
A guard can see in all four cardinal directions (north, east, south, west). 
Their vision continues in a straight line until it hits a wall, another guard, or the edge of the grid. 
Any cell a guard can see is considered guarded.
The goal is to calculate and return the total number of unoccupied cells (cells that are not a guard or a wall) that are not guarded.

Solution Approach:

The most straightforward approach is to simulate the guards' vision directly on a 2D grid. We use a simulation matrix to track the state of every cell.
Initialize a Grid: Create an int[m][n] matrix, let's call it grid. We'll use integer codes to represent the state of each cell:
0: Empty and unguarded
1: Guarded
2: An obstacle (a wall or a guard)

Mark Obstacles: Iterate through both the walls and guards arrays. For each coordinate, mark its position in our grid with 2. This is crucial because walls and other guards block a guard's line of sight.
Simulate Guard Vision: Iterate through the guards array one more time. For each guard's position [r, c]:
Define the four cardinal directions (e.g., using dr = {0, 0, 1, -1} and dc = {1, -1, 0, 0}).
For each of the four directions:
Start a "beam" from the guard's position, moving one step at a time in the current direction.
Use a while loop that continues as long as the beam is within the grid boundaries.
Inside the loop, check the next cell:
If the cell is an obstacle (grid[nr][nc] == 2), the vision is blocked. break this direction's loop.
If the cell is not an obstacle (it's 0 or 1), mark it as guarded (grid[nr][nc] = 1).
Continue moving the beam (nr += dr[i], nc += dc[i]).
Count Unguarded Cells: After simulating all guards, iterate through the entire m x n grid. Count every cell that still has a value of 0. 
This is our final answer, as these are the cells that are unoccupied and were never reached by a guard's vision.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int countUnguarded(int m, int n, int[][] guards, int[][] walls) {
        int[][] grid = new int[m][n];

        for (int[] wall : walls) {
            grid[wall[0]][wall[1]] = 2;
        }
        for (int[] guard : guards) {
            grid[guard[0]][guard[1]] = 2;
        }

        int[] dr = {0, 0, 1, -1};
        int[] dc = {1, -1, 0, 0};

        for (int[] guard : guards) {
            int r = guard[0];
            int c = guard[1];

            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int nr = r + dr[i];
                int nc = c + dc[i];

                while (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n) {
                    if (grid[nr][nc] == 2) {
                        break;
                    }
                    grid[nr][nc] = 1;
                    nr += dr[i];
                    nc += dc[i];
                }
            }
        }

        int unguardedCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    unguardedCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        return unguardedCount;
    }
}
