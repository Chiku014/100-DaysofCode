Day 187/200: Maximum Number of K-Divisible Components 

Problem Statement #2872

Problem Statement Explantion:

There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node, and an integer k.
A valid split of the tree is obtained by removing any set of edges, possibly empty, from the tree such that the resulting components all have values that are divisible by k, where the value of a connected component is the sum of the values of its nodes.
Return the maximum number of components in any valid split.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,2],[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], values = [1,8,1,4,4], k = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 1 and 2. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing nodes 1 and 3 is values[1] + values[3] = 12.
- The value of the component containing nodes 0, 2, and 4 is values[0] + values[2] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 2 connected components.

Example 2:

Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [3,0,6,1,5,2,1], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We remove the edge connecting node 0 with 2, and the edge connecting node 0 with 1. The resulting split is valid because:
- The value of the component containing node 0 is values[0] = 3.
- The value of the component containing nodes 2, 5, and 6 is values[2] + values[5] + values[6] = 9.
- The value of the component containing nodes 1, 3, and 4 is values[1] + values[3] + values[4] = 6.
It can be shown that no other valid split has more than 3 connected components.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 3 * 10^4
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
values.length == n
0 <= values[i] <= 10^9
1 <= k <= 10^9
Sum of values is divisible by k
The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree

Solution Approach:

Algorithm: DFS with Greedy Component Separation
The solution uses a depth-first search (DFS) traversal with a greedy approach to maximize the number of components.
Key Insight: We can greedily separate a subtree into its own component whenever its sum is divisible by k. This is optimal because:
The problem guarantees the total sum is divisible by k
Separating valid components early doesn't prevent us from forming valid components later
Each separation increases our count without losing the ability to form more components

Steps:

Build Graph: Create an adjacency list representation of the tree from the edges array
DFS Traversal: Starting from any node (we use node 0):
Calculate the sum of the current subtree by adding:
The current node's value
The sums returned from all child subtrees
Component Separation: For each subtree:

If the sum is divisible by k:
Increment the component count
Return 0 to the parent (indicating this component is separated)

Otherwise:
Return the sum to the parent (values remain part of parent's component)
Result: The total count represents the maximum number of valid components
Why This Works
When we find a subtree with sum divisible by k, we can immediately separate it as a component. By returning 0 to the parent, we ensure:

The parent node doesn't include these values in its calculation
We've maximized components by greedily taking valid splits
The remaining tree still maintains the property that its total sum is divisible by k

Here's the code:

import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private int count = 0;
    
    public int maxKDivisibleComponents(int n, int[][] edges, int[] values, int k) {
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        count = 0;
        dfs(0, -1, graph, values, k);
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private long dfs(int node, int parent, List<List<Integer>> graph, int[] values, int k) {
        long sum = values[node];
        
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                sum += dfs(neighbor, node, graph, values, k);
            }
        }
        
        if (sum % k == 0) {
            count++;
            return 0;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
