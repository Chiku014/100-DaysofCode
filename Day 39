Day 39/100: Find the Kth Charater in String Game 1

Problem Statement #3304

Problem Statement Explanation:

Alice and Bob are playing a game. 
Initially, Alice has a string `word = "a"`. Bob asks Alice to perform operations where she generates a new string by changing each character in `word` to its next character in the English alphabet (with 'z' wrapping around to 'a') and appends it to the original `word`. 
The task is to return the k-th character in the resulting string after enough operations.

Solution Approach:

1. Start with the initial string "a".
2. Repeatedly generate the next part of the string by incrementing each character and append it to the original string.
3. Continue until the string's length is at least `k`.
4. Return the k-th character (1-based index).

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public char kthCharacter(int k) {
        StringBuilder word = new StringBuilder("a");
        while (word.length() < k) {
            StringBuilder nextPart = new StringBuilder();
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                char c = word.charAt(i);
                if (c == 'z') {
                    nextPart.append('a');
                } else {
                    nextPart.append((char)(c + 1));
                }
            }
            word.append(nextPart);
        }
        return word.charAt(k - 1);
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(k)
Space Complexity: O(k)
