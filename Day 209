Day 209/250: Delete Columns to Make Sorted

Problem Statement #944

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.
The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each row, making a grid. 
For example, if strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"], it looks like this:

Plaintext

abc
bce
cae


You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. 
In the example above (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.
Return the number of columns that you will delete.

To determine if a column is sorted, we compare each character with the character directly above it.

In the grid:

Sorted Column: Every character at strs[row][col] must be greater than or equal to strs[row-1][col].
Unsorted Column: If we find even one instance where strs[row][col] < strs[row-1][col], the entire column is invalid.

Solution Approach:

Identify Dimensions: Get the number of rows (array length) and the number of columns (length of the first string).
Outer Loop (Columns): Iterate through each column index from 0 to K-1.
Inner Loop (Rows): Iterate through each row starting from index 1.
Comparison: Compare the character at the current row with the character at the previous row for that specific column.
Counting: If the order is broken, increment our deletionCount and break the inner loop immediately (we don't need to check the rest of a column once it's marked for deletion).

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int deletionCount = 0;
        int rowCount = strs.length;
        int colCount = strs[0].length();

        for (int col = 0; col < colCount; col++) {
            for (int row = 1; row < rowCount; row++) {
                if (strs[row].charAt(col) < strs[row - 1].charAt(col)) {
                    deletionCount++;
                    break; 
                }
            }
        }
        return deletionCount;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N×K)
Space Complexity: O(1)
