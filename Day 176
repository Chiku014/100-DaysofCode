Day 176/200: Check If All 1s Are at Least Length K Places Away

Problem Statement #1437

Problem Statement Explantion:

Given a binary array nums (containing only 0s and 1s) and an integer k, return true if all 1s are at least k places away from each other, otherwise return false.
The "distance" between two 1s is the number of 0s between them.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The first 1 and second 1 have three 0s between them. 
The second 1 and third 1 have two 0s between them. All 1s are at least k=2 places apart.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only separated by one 0, which is less than the required k=2.

Solution Approach:

The most efficient way to solve this is with a single pass through the array. 
We can keep track of the number of zeros we've seen since the last 1.
Initialize a counter zeroCount to k.
This is a clever trick to handle the edge case of the very first 1. 
Since the first 1 has no preceding 1 to measure against, initializing the count to k ensures it will always pass the check (since k < k is false).
Iterate through each number num in the nums array.

If num is 1:

We check our counter. 
If zeroCount is less than k, it means we've found a 1 that is too close to the previous 1. We can immediately return false.
If the check passes, we reset zeroCount to 0 because we need to start counting the zeros after this new 1.

If num is 0:

We simply increment zeroCount.
If we finish the entire loop without returning false, it means all 1s were spaced correctly, so we return true.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public boolean kLengthApart(int[] nums, int k) {
        int zeroCount = k;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) {
                if (zeroCount < k) {
                    return false;
                }
                zeroCount = 0;
            } else {
                zeroCount++;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
