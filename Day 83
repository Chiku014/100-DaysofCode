Day 83/100: Maximum 69 Numbers

Problem Statement #1323

Problem Statement Explanation:

You're given a positive integer num that consists of only the digits 6 and 9. 
You can change at most one digit (a 6 to a 9, or a 9 to a 6). 
The goal is to return the maximum possible number you can get after making at most one change.

Example 1:
Input: num = 9669
Output: 9969
Explanation: Changing the first '6' to a '9' results in the largest number.

Example 2:
Input: num = 9999
Output: 9999
Explanation: No '6's exist to change, so the number is already at its maximum.

Solution Approach
To get the largest possible number, you want to make the most significant change possible. 
Since '9' is greater than '6', the best strategy is to find the leftmost '6' and convert it to a '9'. This increases the number's value by the largest amount. 
If there are no '6's, the number is already maximized, and we don't need to do anything.
The algorithm is straightforward:

Convert the input number num into a string or a character array. 
This makes it easy to inspect and modify individual digits.

Iterate through the digits from left to right.
Find the first occurrence of the digit '6'.
Change that '6' to a '9' and immediately stop the search, as we only get to make one change.
Convert the modified character array or string back into an integer and return it.
