Day 148/150: Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

Problem Statement #2011

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given an array of strings operations, where each element is one of the following:

"++X" → increment x by 1
"X++" → increment x by 1
"--X" → decrement x by 1
"X--" → decrement x by 1

Initially, x = 0.
Return the final value of x after performing all the operations in the array.

Each operation directly affects the variable x:
Any operation containing "++" increases x by 1.
Any operation containing "--" decreases x by 1.
We simply iterate through the array, check each operation, and update the variable accordingly.

Solution Approach:

Initialize x = 0.
Loop through all elements in operations.
If the current operation contains "++", increment x.
Else (for "--"), decrement x.
Return the final value of x.
This uses straightforward iteration and string matching — no extra data structures are needed.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x = 0;
        for (String op : operations) {
            if (op.contains("++")) {
                x++;
            } else {
                x--;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
