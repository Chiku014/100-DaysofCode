Day 157/200: Smallest Number With All Set Bits

Problem Statement #3370

Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer n, find the smallest integer x such that:
x >= n, and
the binary representation of x contains only set bits (1s).
In other words, x should be of the form 111...1 in binary (e.g., 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, etc.).

Explanation:
Binary of 5 = 101.
The smallest number â‰¥ 5 that has all set bits is 111 (binary), which equals 7.

Solution Approach:
Any number that has all bits set is of the form 2^k - 1.
We need to find the smallest integer k such that 2^k - 1 >= n.
The bit-length of n (number of bits required to represent n) is k.
Thus, the result can be directly computed as (1 << k) - 1,
where k = Integer.SIZE - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n).
This gives an O(1) and elegant bit-manipulation solution.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int smallestNumber(int n) {
        int len = Integer.SIZE - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(n);
        return (1 << len) - 1;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
