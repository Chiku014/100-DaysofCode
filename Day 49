Day 49/100: Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers

Problem Statement #2410

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers`. 
A player can be matched with a trainer if the player's ability is less than or equal to the trainer's capacity. 
Return the maximum number of matchings that can be formed.

Solution Approach:

Sort both `players` and `trainers`.
Use a two-pointer greedy approach.
Match the smallest possible player with the smallest capable trainer.

Here's the code:

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);
        
        int i = 0, j = 0, matches = 0;

        while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                matches++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return matches;
    }
}
