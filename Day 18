Day 18/100: Maximum Difference between Adjacent Elements in a circular Array

Problem Statement #3423

Approach:
Iterate Through the Array: For each element in the array, calculate the absolute difference with the next element. 
For the last element, calculate the absolute difference with the first element to account for the circular nature.
Track Maximum Difference: Keep track of the maximum absolute difference encountered during the iteration.

Here's the code;

class Solution {
    public int maxAdjacentDistance(int[] nums) {
        int maxDiff = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int nextIndex = (i + 1) % n;
            int currentDiff = Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[nextIndex]);
            if (currentDiff > maxDiff) {
                maxDiff = currentDiff;
            }
        }

        return maxDiff;
    }
}

Complexity:
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space complexity is O(1)
