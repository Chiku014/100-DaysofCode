Day 96/100: Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game

Problem Statement #3021

Problem Statement Explanation:

Alice and Bob are playing a game with flowers. 
There are two gardens, one with n flowers and the other with m flowers. 
Alice picks a number of flowers x such that 1 <= x <= n, and Bob picks a number of flowers y such that 1 <= y <= m.

The rule for winning is simple: 
Alice wins if the total number of flowers they pick, x + y, is an odd number. 
Your task is to calculate the total number of different pairs (x, y) that result in Alice winning.

Solution Approach:

Alice wins if the total flowers, x + y, is odd. 
This only happens if one person picks an even number and the other picks an odd number.
Instead of counting every combination, we can use a simpler insight. 
Out of all n * m possible pairs, exactly half will have an odd sum. Therefore, the total number of ways Alice can win is simply the total number of pairs divided by two.

The formula is:
Total Wins = (n * m) / 2

A 64-bit integer type (like long in Java) is necessary for the calculation to prevent overflow since n and m can be large.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public long flowerGame(int n, int m) {
        long evenCountN = n / 2;
        long oddCountN = (n + 1) / 2;

        long evenCountM = m / 2;
        long oddCountM = (m + 1) / 2;

        long firstCase = evenCountN * oddCountM;
        long secondCase = oddCountN * evenCountM;

        return firstCase + secondCase;
    }
}
