Day 214/250: Maximize Happiness Greedy

Problem Statement #3075

Problem Statement Explantion:

You are given an array happiness of size n, and a positive integer k. 
There are n children standing in a queue, where the ith child has a happiness value happiness[i].
You want to select k children from these n children in k turns. 
In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been selected yet decreases by 1. 
Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and is only decremented if it is positive.
Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by selecting exactly k children.

Solution Approach:

To maximize the total happiness, we should always pick the child with the highest available happiness value at each step.
Sorting: We sort the happiness array in ascending order. This allows us to easily access the largest values from the end of the array.

Decremented Values: In the ith turn (starting from i=0), the happiness value of the chosen child will have decreased by i units.
Calculation: Pick the largest remaining value: happiness[n - 1 - i].
Subtract the number of turns passed: happiness[n - 1 - i] - i.
If the resulting value is positive, add it to the total. If it reaches 0 or less, we stop or add 0 because happiness cannot be negative.
Efficiency: Sorting takes O(nlogn), and the selection takes O(k), making this approach highly efficient.

Here's the code:

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public long maximumHappinessSum(int[] happiness, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(happiness);
        
        long totalHappiness = 0;
        int n = happiness.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int currentHappiness = happiness[n - 1 - i] - i;
            
            if (currentHappiness > 0) {
                totalHappiness += currentHappiness;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return totalHappiness;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
Space Complexity: O(1)
