Day 213/250: Apple Redistribution into Boxes

Problem Statement #3074

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m. There are n packs of apples, where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. 
There are also m empty boxes, where the jth box has a capacity of capacity[j] apples.
Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes. 
Note that apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

Solution Approach:

To minimize the number of boxes used, we apply a Greedy Strategy:

Sum Total Apples: First, calculate the total count of all apples across all packs. 
Since we can split packs, the individual sizes in the apple array don't matter as much as the total sum.
Maximize Box Usage: To use the fewest boxes, we must use the ones with the largest capacities first.
Sort and Iterate: Sort the capacity array in ascending order. 
Iterate from the end of the array (the largest boxes) and subtract the box capacity from the total apple sum until the sum becomes zero or negative

Here's the code:

import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int minimumBoxes(int[] apple, int[] capacity) {
        int totalApples = 0;
        for (int a : apple) {
            totalApples += a;
        }

        Arrays.sort(capacity);
        
        int boxesUsed = 0;
        for (int i = capacity.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            totalApples -= capacity[i];
            boxesUsed++;

            if (totalApples <= 0) {
                break;
            }
        }

        return boxesUsed;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity:	O(n+mlogm)
Space Complexity:	O(1)
