Day 188/200: Minimum Operttions to Make Array Sum Divisible by K

Problem Statement #3512

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
You are allowed to perform operations on the array, where in one operation, you can change any single element to any integer you want.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make:
sum(nums) % k == 0

There are only two possibilities:

✅ Case 1: r == 0
The sum is already divisible by k.
→ No operation needed → answer = 0

✅ Case 2: r != 0
You can always change one element to fix the remaining amount and make the sum divisible by k, because you can change it to any number.

So the answer is always:

0 if remainder is 0
1 if remainder is not 0

Solution Approach:

Compute the sum of all elements.
Check sum % k.
If remainder = 0 → return 0
Otherwise → return 1
This works because modifying a single element is enough to adjust the total sum to the nearest multiple of k.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum % k == 0 ? 0 : 1;
    }
}
