Day 175/200: Number of Substrings With Only 1s

Problem Statement Explanation:

Given a binary string s, return the number of substrings with all characters 1's.
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: s = "0110111"
Output: 9
Explanation: There are 9 substrings with only 1's characters.
"1" appears 5 times.
"11" appears 3 times.
"111" appears 1 time.

Example 2:
Input: s = "101"
Output: 2
Explanation: Substring "1" appears 2 times.

Example 3:
Input: s = "111111"
Output: 21
Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
s[i] is either '0' or '1'
Solution Approach
The key insight is that for a continuous sequence of n ones, the total number of substrings is n * (n + 1) / 2.
Instead of calculating this at the end for each group, we use an incremental counting approach:

Solution Approach:

Iterate through the string character by character
When we encounter a '1':
Increment a counter that tracks consecutive 1's
Add the current count to the result (this represents all substrings ending at the current position)
When we encounter a '0':
Reset the counter to 0
Apply modulo operation to prevent overflow
When we see consecutive 1's:

First '1': adds 1 substring (just "1")
Second '1': adds 2 substrings ("1" and "11")
Third '1': adds 3 substrings ("1", "11", "111")
This incremental addition achieves the same result as the formula n * (n + 1) / 2 but does it in one pass.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int numSub(String s) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long result = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                count++;
                result = (result + count) % MOD;
            } else {
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) result;
    }
}
