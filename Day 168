Day 168/200: Count Operations to Obtain Zero

Problem Statemnt #2169

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2.
In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1. 
Otherwise, you must subtract num1 from num2.
For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 3, you subtract 3 from 5, and the new values are num1 = 2 and num2 = 3.\
The process is repeated until either num1 or num2 becomes 0. 
Return the total number of operations performed.

Solution Approach:

We present two approaches: a direct simulation and an optimized solution using the modulus operator.

Approach 1: Direct Simulation
This approach follows the problem description exactly.
Initialize an operations counter to 0.
Create a while loop that continues as long as both num1 and num2 are not equal to 0.

Inside the loop:
Check if num1 >= num2.
If true, update num1 = num1 - num2.
If false, update num2 = num2 - num1.
Increment the operations counter.
Once the loop terminates (because one of the numbers is 0), return the operations count.
This solution is straightforward but inefficient for large inputs, as it may require millions of subtraction steps.

Approach 2: Optimized using Modulus (Euclidean Algorithm)
The "Direct Simulation" is slow because repeated subtraction is mathematically equivalent to division.
For example, if num1 = 100 and num2 = 3:
The simulation would subtract 3 from 100 thirty-three times (100, 97, 94, ..., 4, 1). This takes 33 operations.
We can get this result in one step: 100 / 3 = 33 operations.
The new value of num1 would be the remainder: 100 % 3 = 1.
This optimization is the core principle of the Euclidean algorithm.
Initialize an operations counter to 0.
Create a while loop that continues as long as both num1 and num2 are not equal to 0.

Inside the loop:
If num1 >= num2:
Calculate how many times num2 fits into num1: int steps = num1 / num2.
Add these steps to the total operations.
Set num1 to the remainder: num1 = num1 % num2.

Else (num1 < num2):
Calculate int steps = num2 / num1.
Add steps to operations.
Set num2 to the remainder: num2 = num2 % num1.
Return the operations count.
This approach is significantly faster and avoids the "Time Limit Exceeded" (TLE) error on LeetCode.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (num1 != 0 && num2 != 0) {
            if (num1 >= num2) {
                num1 = num1 - num2;
            } else {
                num2 = num2 - num1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        return operations;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(max(num1,num2))
Space Complexity: O(1)
