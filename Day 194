Day 194/200:  Count Partitions with Even Sum Difference

Problem Statement #3432

Problem Statement Explantion:

Given an integer array nums of length n, you need to partition it into two non-empty subarrays: Left (indices 0 to i) and Right (indices i+1 to n-1).
We need to calculate the difference between the sum of the left subarray and the sum of the right subarray:
difference=sum(left)−sum(right)
Goal: Return the number of partitions where this difference is even.

Example:
Input: nums = [2, 4, 6, 8] Output: 3 Explanation: All 3 possible partitions result in an even difference.

Solution Approach:

Algorithm
Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.

If the total sum is even, every possible partition (n−1 partitions) is valid.

If the total sum is odd, no partition is valid (return 0).

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int countPartitions(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }

        int leftSum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            leftSum += nums[i];
            int rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;

            if ((leftSum - rightSum) % 2 == 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
