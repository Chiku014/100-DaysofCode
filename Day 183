Day 183/200: Binary Prefix Divisible By 5

Problem Statement #1018

Problem Statement Explanation:

Given an array nums of 0s and 1s, consider the binary representation of the subarray nums[0...i] for each index i. 
We need to return a list of boolean values where the ith value is true if the binary number represented by the prefix nums[0...i] is divisible by 5, and false otherwise.

Intuition:
The array length can be up to 30,000. A binary number with 30,000 bits is massive (2^30000) and far exceeds the capacity of standard integer types (like long or double).
Therefore, we cannot convert the binary sequence to a number directly. 
Instead, we utilize the properties of modular arithmetic. 
We only care about the remainder when divided by 5.
The relationship between a number and its next state when appending a bit is:

NewNumber=(OldNumber×2+CurrentBit)
By applying the modulo operator at every step, we keep the value small (always between 0 and 4) and prevent integer overflow:

CurrentRemainder=(PreviousRemainder×2+CurrentBit)(mod5)

Solution Approach:

Initialize a variable remainder to 0.
Initialize a result list to store the boolean values.
Iterate through each bit in the nums array:
Update the remainder using the formula: remainder = (remainder * 2 + bit) % 5.
If the remainder is 0, append true to the result list; otherwise, append false.
Return the result list.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> prefixesDivBy5(int[] nums) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int remainder = 0;
        
        for (int bit : nums) {
            remainder = (remainder * 2 + bit) % 5;
            result.add(remainder == 0);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)
