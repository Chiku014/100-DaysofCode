Day 196/200: Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range

Problem Statement #1523

Problem Statement Explanation:

Problem Statement
Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: low = 3, high = 7 Output: 3 Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

Example 2:
Input: low = 8, high = 10 Output: 1 Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].

Solution Approach:

Intuition:
A naive approach would be to iterate from low to high and check if each number is odd. 
However, since the constraint for high is up to 10^9, an O(N) loop will result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE). 
We need a mathematical solution.

Algorithm:
We can calculate the number of odd integers using the property of ranges:
The count of odd numbers from 1 to N is always calculated as (N + 1) / 2.
To find the count in a specific range [low, high], we calculate the total odd numbers from 0 to high and subtract the odd numbers from 0 to low - 1.

The formula used is:

Count = high+1/2 - low/2

Here's the Code:

class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        int count = (high - low) / 2;
        
        if (low % 2 != 0 || high % 2 != 0) {
            count++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
