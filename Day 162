Day 162/200: Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful

Problem Statement #1578

Problem Statement Explanation:

A string colors, where each character represents the color of a balloon.
An integer array neededTime, where neededTime[i] is the time required to remove the i-th balloon.
You need to remove some balloons so that no two adjacent balloons have the same color.
Removing a balloon costs its corresponding neededTime[i].
Return the minimum total time required to make the rope colorful.

Example:

Input: colors = "abaac", neededTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: Remove the second 'a' (cost = 3) → final string = "abac"

Solution Approach:

Traverse through the colors string.
If two consecutive balloons have the same color, remove the one with the smaller neededTime.
Keep the balloon with the larger neededTime for future comparisons.
Accumulate the removal times to get the total minimum cost.
This is a greedy approach, as at each step we make the locally optimal decision — removing the cheaper balloon — which leads to the globally optimal result.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int minCost(String colors, int[] neededTime) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        int n = colors.length();
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors.charAt(i) == colors.charAt(i - 1)) {
                totalTime += Math.min(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
                neededTime[i] = Math.max(neededTime[i], neededTime[i - 1]);
            }
        }
        return totalTime;
    }
}

Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
