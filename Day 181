Day 181/200: Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three

Problem Statement #3190

Problem Statement Explanation:

You are given an integer array nums. 
In one operation, you can add 1 to or subtract 1 from any element of nums.
The goal is to return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in nums divisible by 3.

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- 1: Add 1 -> 2 (not div), Subtract 1 -> 0 (div by 3). Operations: 1.
- 2: Add 1 -> 3 (div by 3). Operations: 1.
- 3: Already divisible by 3. Operations: 0.
- 4: Subtract 1 -> 3 (div by 3). Operations: 1.
Total Operations: 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3

Solution Approach:

To minimize operations, we need to find the closest number divisible by 3 for every element in the array. 
We can determine this using the modulo operator (%).
For any integer n, there are three possibilities when divided by 3:
Remainder 0 (n%3==0): The number is already divisible by 3.

Operations needed: 0
Remainder 1 (n%3==1): The number is 1 greater than a multiple of 3. We subtract 1.

Operations needed: 1
Remainder 2 (n%3==2): The number is 1 less than a multiple of 3. We add 1.

Operations needed: 1
Conclusion: If a number is not divisible by 3, it requires exactly 1 operation. If it is divisible, it requires 0 operations. We simply count how many numbers are not divisible by 3.

Here's the code:

class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 3 != 0) {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}

complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
